# Benchmark data collection configuration

mode: data_collection

# Data collection for which predictor
collect_for: n2m  # or 'mobipi'

# Number of valid data samples to collect (successful episodes)
num_valid_data: 20

# N2M data collection
n2m_data_collection_randomization:
  x: [-0.2, 0.2]      # ±0.2m in x direction
  y: [-0.2, 0.2]      # ±0.2m in y direction
  theta: [-0.262, 0.262]  # ±15 degrees (0.262 radians)

# Note: horizon is read from JSON config (train.data[0].horizon or experiment.rollout.horizon)

# Save directory (will be resolved based on collect_for)
